What is Computer Programming?
Computer programming is the process of creating instructions that tell a computer how
to perform tasks. These instructions, written in code, guide the computer to execute
simple calculations, manage data, or perform complex operations. Programming is the
foundation of all software applications, from web browsers and games to artificial
intelligence.
Programming Languages
A programming language is a medium for programmers to write code in a structured
way. It allows humans to communicate instructions to computers. Some of the essential
programming languages include Java, C++, HTML, SQL, and Python. Each language
has its unique purpose: Java for enterprise applications, C++ for performance-heavy
applications, HTML for structuring web pages, SQL for databases, and Python for
general-purpose development.

Introduction to Python
Python is a versatile programming language widely used in web development, data
analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. It was created by Guido van
Rossum in 1991 and later developed by the Python Software Foundation. Python
emphasizes code readability and allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines
of code. Its name 'Python' was chosen for being short, unique, and slightly mysterious.
Applications of Python
Python has a wide range of applications:
- Game Development
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Web Development
- Data Science and Data Visualization
These applications make Python one of the most in-demand programming languages in
the modern software industry.
Setting up Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free and lightweight code editor developed by
Microsoft. It supports numerous programming languages and comes with features such
as syntax highlighting, debugging, and version control integration. Key features include
text editing, extensions, debugging support, and high customization. This makes it an
excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.
Git & GitHub
Git is a version control tool that helps track changes in your code. It allows
programmers to save snapshots of their projects, track progress, revert changes, and
collaborate effectively. GitHub is a cloud-based platform where Git repositories can be
hosted and shared. It enables collaboration, contribution, and sharing of projects across
the world.
Folder Structure
A folder structure is the way files and directories are organized on a computer.
Maintaining a clean and logical folder structure is important for clarity, efficiency, and
collaboration. For example, keeping source code, documentation, and assets in
separate folders helps avoid confusion and improves workflow.

Install & Use Extensions in VS Code
Extensions in VS Code add extra functionality. For example, the Python extension
enables debugging and virtual environment management. The Live Share extension
allows multiple users to collaborate on the same project in real-time. These tools
transform VS Code into a powerful integrated development environment (IDE).
Git Configuration
To configure Git for the first time, you need to set your username and email, which
helps identify your commits. This is done using the commands:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
Once configured, Git will use these details in all your repositories.
Push Code to GitHub
The process of pushing code to GitHub typically involves the following steps:
1. Initialize Repository: Git starts tracking changes in your project.
2. Commit: Save a snapshot of your project at a particular point in time.
3. Push: Upload your commits to a GitHub repository online.
This process ensures that your code is backed up, versioned, and available for
collaboration.
Summary
In this lesson, we explored the fundamentals of computer programming, programming
languages, and Python's unique role in modern software development. We also learned
how to set up a development environment using Visual Studio Code, configure Git for
version control, and leverage GitHub for project collaboration. Finally, we studied folder
structures, extensions. These concepts form the foundation for anyone beginning their
journey in computer science and software development.
